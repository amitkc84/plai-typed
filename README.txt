This is the `plai-typed' package, which provides the `plai-typed'
collection.

It's meant to be installed with the Racket package manager:

 raco pkg install plai-typed


If you're not yet using Racket v5.3.1.5 ot later, you can also just
link the `plai-typed' collection directly (with the following command
in this directory of this "README.txt", not its parent):

 raco link plai-typed
